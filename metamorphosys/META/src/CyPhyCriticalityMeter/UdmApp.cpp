/* 
Remarks to CUdmApp::UdmMain(...):
0.	The p_backend points to an already open backend, and the framework 
	closes it automatically. DO NOT OPEN OR CLOSE IT!
	To commit changes use p_backend->CommitEditSequence().
	To abort changes use p_backend->AbortEditSequence().
	To save changes to a different file use p_backend->SaveAs() or p_backend->CloseAs().

1.	Focus is the currently open model.

2.	The possible values for param (from GME DecoratorLib.h component_startmode_enum):
	GME_MAIN_START			=   0,
	GME_BROWSER_START		=   1,
	GME_CONTEXT_START		=   2,
	GME_EMBEDDED_START		=   3,
	GME_MENU_START			=  16,
	GME_BGCONTEXT_START		=  18,
	GME_ICON_START			=  32,
	METAMODEL_CHECK_SYNTAX	= 101

 3. The framework catches all the exceptions and reports the error in a message box,
	clean up and close the transactions aborting the changes. You can override this 
	behavior by catching udm_exception. Use udm_exception::what() to form an error 
	message.
