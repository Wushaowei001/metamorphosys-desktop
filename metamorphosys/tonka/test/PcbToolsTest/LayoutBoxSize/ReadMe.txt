This directory is used by the PcbToolsTest CheckThatLayoutHasBoardSizeCorrect()
unit test in the ReverseBoardSynthesisTest.cs file.  It was created to partially
test MOT-788, to verify that reverse board synthesis puts the board height and
width from the EAGLE ".brd" file into the generated "layout.json" file.
